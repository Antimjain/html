<h2>The autocomplete Attribute</h2>

<form action="/action_page.php" autocomplete="on">
  First name:<input type="text" name="fname"><br>
  Last name: <input type="text" name="lname"><br>
  E-mail: <input type="email" name="email" autocomplete="off"><br>
  <input type="submit">
</form>

<p>Fill in and submit the form, then reload the page to see how autocomplete works.</p>
<p>Notice that autocomplete is "on" for the form, but "off" for the e-mail field.</p>

The autocomplete attribute specifies whether a form or input field should have autocomplete on or off.

When autocomplete is on, the browser automatically completes the input values based on values that the user has entered before.

Tip: It is possible to have autocomplete "on" for the form, and "off" for specific input fields, or vice versa.

The autocomplete attribute works with <form> and the following <input> types: text, search, url, tel, email, password, datepickers, range, and color.
