<!-- The <span> element is often used as a container for some text.

The <span> element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.

When used together with CSS, the <span> element can be used to style parts of the text: -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>My <span style="color:red">Important</span> Heading</h1>

</body>
</html>
