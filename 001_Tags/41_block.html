<!-- 
The two display values are: block and inline.
Block Element = always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available 
                (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
                <div>Hello World</div>

The <div> element is often used as a container for other HTML elements.
The <div> element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.
When used together with CSS, the <div> element can be used to style blocks of content:

<address><article><aside><blockquote><canvas>
<dd><div><dl><dt><fieldset><figcaption><figure><footer>
<form><h1>-<h6><header><hr><li><main><nav><noscript>
<ol><p><pre><section><table><tfoot><ul><video></video> 
-->
