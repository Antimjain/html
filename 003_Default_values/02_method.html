method => get
          post


However, when GET is used, the submitted form data will be visible in the page address field:
default => get


Notes on GET:
Appends form-data into the URL in name/value pairs
The length of a URL is limited (2048 characters)
Never use GET to send sensitive data! (will be visible in the URL)
Useful for form submissions where a user wants to bookmark the result
GET is better for non-secure data, like query strings in Google


Notes on POST:
POST has no size limitations, and can be used to send large amounts of data.
Form submissions with POST cannot be bookmarked
Always use POST if the form data contains sensitive or personal information. 
The POST method does not display the submitted form data in the page address field.
